# GreenTask Pro

GreenTask Pro is a lightweight, offline-first CRM built for solo lawn and grounds maintenance professionals. It runs entirely in the browser (desktop or mobile) with no logins or backend required.

## Features

- **Dashboard** with quick access to Clients, Calendar, Notes, and Invoicing modules.
- **Clients**: store contact details, service notes, and tap-to-call/text actions.
- **Calendar**: seven-day (Sunday–Saturday) planner to add, complete, reschedule, or remove jobs.
- **Notes**: capture titled notes with support for photos or short videos stored locally.
- **Invoicing**: create professional invoices with automatic tax, senior, and veteran discounts. Print to PDF or send via text message.
- **Offline-first**: data persists in the browser using `localStorage`, and a service worker caches core assets for unreliable connections.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox). Add it to your home screen for an app-like experience.
2. Add a few clients. Their information becomes available across the calendar and invoicing modules.
3. Plan your week using the calendar form. Jobs can be marked complete, rescheduled, or removed.
4. Capture job-site notes and attach media when needed.
5. Generate invoices, review the auto-calculated totals, then print or send via SMS directly from your phone.

Your information stays on the device—export your browser data periodically if you need an external backup.
